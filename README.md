# RAMDO Solutions

After finishing my Ph.D. I co-founded the company RAMDO Solutions. There is more on that below in the [My RAMDO Solutions Journey](#my-ramdo-solutions-journey) section. As a co-founder of a small business, I worked in every role of a business, even taking out the trash and cleaning the office. I made mistakes along the way, but I learned a lot as well!

### What I did at RAMDO Solutions
I managed two SBIR Phase II contracts, $1 Million each, for the development and commercialization of the RAMDO software. I managed a team consisting of developers, researchers, business development, and administration. I also worked directly on software development of the computational engine of RAMDO, which was coded in MATLAB object-oriented programming, carried out R&D studies to develop new methods, helped with user interface Java development, and mentored our user interface developer.

Additionally, I oversaw and worked on consulting projects with customers applying data science and RAMDO methods and techniques using Python, JavaScript, shell scripts, etc., (whatever it took) to solve their problem. I have applied these techniques across various domains and industries: CFD, multibody dynamics, durability, NVH, vehicle safety analysis, blast survivability analysis, die casting simulations, welding, wind turbine design, drag in shock-particle interactions, terramechanics connected with geospatial for the creation of vehicle speed maps for Next Generation NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM). I was involved with NATO committees to help with the development of the Next Generation NRMM (NG-NRMM) and mobility of autonomous military ground systems.

### What was the RAMDO software
The RAMDO software was a software tool that could be used to carry out uncertainty quantification, reliability analysis, surrogate/meta modeling (a supervised machine learning method), simulation model validation, variable screening, statistical distribution identification using test data, deterministic and probabilistic optimization.

### The short story
I co-founded the company RAMDO Solutions after finishing my Ph.D. to commercialize the software developed in the research group I worked with during my Ph.D. at the University of Iowa. I was the one who pulled together the research code from ten different Ph.D. students to create a commercial software tool. When I started RAMDO Solutions I knew nothing about a business, what it required to start a business, build a business, how to sell, how to identify if there was even a market for the product, how to hire employees, etc. I made a lot of mistakes along the way. But I also learned a lot as well! It was extremely difficult and hard, but I had amazing support from God, my wife, family, friends, and colleagues. I had the opportunity to learn all those things and more. I built and led a small team. I worked with numerous clients and colleagues from across the world. Working on NATO committees and business trips allowed me to travel to six other countries and meet new colleagues and friends around the world.

Starting out cash flow was not a problem because of the SBIR contracts we had. I was able to hire and build a small team, and the company grew a little. The sales cycle was painful for a small company, about two years from first contact with a client to an actual paid project. But nonetheless consulting projects and contracts were obtained and revenue was coming in. Business was booming and things were good.

Then things started to slow down. The SBIR contracts were coming to an end, and the long sales cycle was not good for cash flow. Ultimately, I had to let the entire team I built go when the SBIR contracts ended. The consulting projects were not enough to support everyone. The company was down to just me as the only employee. 

I continued working on consulting projects and pursued new ones as well. Some new projects were obtained. There was even the potential for more to come. However, I learned that big companies move slowly, too slow for a small company, and the consulting projects could not come fast enough to keep cash flowing.

The time finally came when either an investor was needed to take the company to the next level or it was time to close the doors. I put together a pitch and submitted it to a venture capital company I had found whom I thought might be interested in investing. Honestly, I already knew that RAMDO Solutions was not an investable company, it would take a true angel investor. While waiting for a response, I started reaching out to colleagues to start the search for a new position. It turned out that one of my colleagues I connected with knew an angel investor and worked with them. I ended up pitching to this angel investor and he liked it! It was a good thing too, because the venture company I submitted the pitch to eventually responded saying they were not interested.

Working together with the angel investor an idea and plan of how to move forward and take RAMDO Solutions to the next level came into existence. While my partner initially seemed interested in the idea of working with the angel investor, he later changed his mind. I learned another thing about starting a company. The initial structure of the company is critical and an exit plan at the beginning needs to be clearly defined. If some kind of exit plan cannot be agreed on between co-founders before starting the company, then it might be best to never start it at all. It turned out that even though I was one of the co-founders and part owner of RAMDO Solutions, I did not have any power to do anything or any way to move forward with RAMDO Solutions and the angel investor. In the end my partner decided he would rather close down RAMDO Solutions than move forward with the angel investor. It was time for me to move on to something new.

I am grateful and thankful for the experience of having started RAMDO Solutions and for all the friends and colleagues I got to know. I learned a lot as well! Thank you to everyone who supported and helped me along the way!
